## 1. Introduction

Curling Ai ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile game that simulates the sport of curling. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices. By using Curling Ai, you agree to this policy.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

We may collect the following types of information:

### 2.1 Information you provide
- **Nickname / display name** — When you set a nickname in the app (e.g. for multiplayer, clans, or leaderboards), this is stored so other players and our services can display it.
- **Game-related data** — Such as scores, clan membership, leaderboard entries, and multiplayer room data, to provide gameplay and social features.

### 2.2 Automatically collected information
- **Device information** — Device type, operating system (iOS/Android), and app version, to ensure compatibility and improve the app.
- **Advertising identifier** — On both iOS and Android we use the advertising ID (IDFA / GAID) to show ads and for limited analytics related to ads. You can limit or reset this in your device settings.
- **Push notification token** — If you allow notifications, we store a token (e.g. Firebase Cloud Messaging) to send you notifications (e.g. game invites, reminders). This is processed by Google Firebase.

### 2.3 Data stored with third-party services
- **Firebase (Google)** — We use Firebase Realtime Database for multiplayer rooms, matchmaking, clans, and leaderboards, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications. Data sent to Firebase is subject to [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **Google AdMob** — We show ads (including rewarded and interstitial) via AdMob. AdMob may collect device and advertising IDs and use cookies/similar technologies. See [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [AdMob help](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543).

We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Provide and improve the game (multiplayer, clans, leaderboards, tactics).
- Show relevant ads and measure ad performance (via AdMob).
- Send push notifications you have agreed to (e.g. game invites, daily reminders).
- Operate and secure our services (e.g. abuse prevention, debugging).
- Comply with applicable laws.

## 4. Third-Party Services

Our app uses these third-party services, each with their own privacy practices:

| Service        | Purpose                          | Privacy / opt-out |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Firebase**   | Database, push notifications      | [Google Privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |
| **Google AdMob** | In-app advertising              | [AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543), [Opt out of personalized ads](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922) |

We recommend reading their policies for details on how they process data.

---

## 5. Data Retention

- **Game and account data** (e.g. nickname, scores, clans) — Retained as long as needed to provide the service and as required by law.
- **Push token** — Retained until you revoke notification permission or uninstall the app.
- **Advertising-related data** — Governed by Google’s and AdMob’s policies; you can reset your advertising ID in your device settings.

We may delete or anonymize data when it is no longer needed for the purposes above.

---

## 6. Security

We use industry-standard measures (including secure connections and, where applicable, Firebase security rules) to protect your data. No system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

Curling Ai is suitable for general audiences (e.g. 3+ / Everyone). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or equivalent age in your country) without parental consent. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us and we will delete it.

---

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

- **Access / correction** — You can see and update your nickname and in-app profile in the app. For other data, contact us.
- **Deletion** — You can request deletion of your data by contacting us. Uninstalling the app will stop new data collection; some data may remain on our or our providers’ systems until deleted in line with this policy.
- **Advertising** — You can turn off personalized ads in your device settings (e.g. iOS: Limit Ad Tracking; Android: Opt out of Ads Personalization). The app may still show non-personalized ads.
- **Push notifications** — You can disable notifications in your device or app settings at any time.

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, you may have additional rights (e.g. access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection). Contact us to exercise them.

## 9. International Transfers

Data may be processed in the United States or other countries where our service providers (e.g. Google) operate. We ensure appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard contractual clauses) where required by law.

---

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new "Last updated" date and, where required by law, notify you (e.g. in the app or by email). Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
